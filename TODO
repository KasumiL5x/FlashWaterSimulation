Todo:
	- Add very subtle idle movement (e.g. opposing blended sine waves)
	- Scroll two normal maps in opposite directions in addition to computing
	- Add caustics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWyWiAOnJ5Y#t=59, http://www.dualheights.se/caustics/, scroll two textures w/ uv distortion and some blending)
	- Add wind and/or sine wave of 'ocean' so it's never static
